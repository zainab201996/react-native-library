# react-native-library
This is a mobile application built using react-native for Viewing and Searching Books


The application consists of two screens
1. Book Information Screen: The screen shows a book information i.e. title, author name, ratings, publication year. It also displays the brief introduction about the Author and overview of the book. Currently the button in the Footer is just a placeholder and does not do anything.
2. Search Screen: The search screen displays top 10 records from Open API library matching the Search Key user enters.

There are navigation buttons to move to and fro between two Screens.
